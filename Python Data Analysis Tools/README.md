# 🐍 Python Data Analysis Tools

This folder contains Python-based data analysis projects that demonstrate your skills in data wrangling, visualization, and algorithmic problem solving. Built using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `seaborn`, these projects were completed as part of freeCodeCamp’s Data Analysis and Scientific Computing with Python certifications — and customized to showcase real analysis output.

## 📂 Output Examples

Each project generates either a `.png` plot or printed terminal output like this:

```
Number of each race:
 race
White                 27816
Black                  3124
Asian-Pac-Islander     1039
Amer-Indian-Eskimo      311
Other                   271
Average age of men: 39.4
```

Plots include:
- Box plots
- Bar charts
- Linear regression trendlines
- Categorical visualizations

# 🐍 Python Data Analysis Tools

This folder contains Python-based data analysis projects that demonstrate skills in data wrangling, visualization, and algorithmic problem solving. Built using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, and `seaborn`, these projects were completed as part of freeCodeCamp’s Data Analysis and Scientific Computing with Python certifications — and customized to showcase real-world analysis output.
